for each place:
  check if this place already belongs to a cluster
  check if this place fits the criteria of any cluster
    check(if all the attributes meet)
  search its nearby places by its own types:
    each type has a list
    if that list contains many visited places:
      find a cluster, add all the places to the cluster
      update cluster info (distance_to_home, distance_to_school etc)
      type -> dominant
      frequency -> sum up



cluster attributes:
  distance_to_home = close/not close
  distance_to_school = close/not close
  center lat,long
  each place's average distance to center lat,long
  type = domi
    if dominant: has a dominant_type
  frequency = frequent/not
